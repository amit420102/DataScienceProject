# Finalproject
Business problem - In current world when a user does a web search for a restaurant in his/her area it returns the point in time rating of business and does not give a comparative rating of venue compared to other venues in the area. 
As part of this project, I am intending to provide a plotting of how an individual venue is rated in comparoson to other venues in the same area. In order to get the data I am intending to use Frousquare API for venues explore around an area. For my project i have used Soho neihgborhood in Manhattan borough to get the details.
For ease of projection the details i have only fetched 20 restaurants in Soho neighborhood.
