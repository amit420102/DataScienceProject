# Finalproject
Business problem - In current world when a user does a web search for a restaurant in his/her area it returns the point in time rating of business and does not give a picture on whether the business as improved, deterirated or have been constant in their ratings. As part of this project, I am intending to provide a plotting of how an individual restaurant is performing over a period of last one year. This will be to provide the user a  hint on how a given business has improved or degraded over a period of time. Project is intending to map the restaurants in a given area and showcase the rating in 3 colors. Red mean that the rating has gone down in past 12 months, green means the performance has improved over time and orange means the performance has been consistent over time. There will be text for the mapping to showcase the current rating as well.
