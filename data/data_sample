GET https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore - this API will be used to fetch details of all the venues around Soho neighborhood. I have restricted the search result to return 20 values for easy comparison.
I have also kept the final dataset data in the data section which was used for final plotting of the venues with comparative rating on the map.
